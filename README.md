Template: Abi Kothapalli

Run the backend with "node index.js", the frontend with "npm run dev". The dependencies you need to run this program include axios, cors, express, moment, nodemon, react-countdown-clock, react-router-dom, styled-components, react, and react-dom.

Brief reflection: Building on Abi's code, I completed the basic requirements quite easily. Some highlights of my code include integrating the dictionary API, offering users the choice of different game duration and difficulties, a timer with ending reminders which keeps track of the elapsed time, and the setup of multiple pages and going back and forth among them.

Project feedback: Super exciting and practical project. Really grateful that Change++ assigns this. Also, again, the workshops and Abi's templates are so helpful.

Potential improvements:
  1. Unfortunately, I don't have enough time for CSS. But definitely potential improvements in terms of website UI.
  2. I was trying to figure out a "skip" functionality. But again, due to the limited timeframe, I chose to pay more attention to the stability of the code.
  3. I could definitely expand the "results" section a lot more by showing what the users answered correctly, what they skipped, etc.

Overall, exciting project which I would definitely continue working on. This project, just as Change++, shows the potential of programming in real life beyond classrooms. Feel free to contact me if you have any further questions!
